// Question 14
How does the hierarchical structure of PointNet++ primarily address the main limitation of the original PointNet? {
    ~By converting the point cloud into a dense voxel grid before processing.
    ~By processing each point in a fixed, canonical order to create a regular structure.
    =By capturing local geometric features at multiple scales, which PointNet approach misses.
    ~By using a single, more powerful T-Net for global transformation invariance.
