This notebook is a merged and updated version based on two notebooks initially developed for the [UPC School's Postgraduate in Artificial Intelligence with Deep Learning](https://www.talent.upc.edu/ing/estudis/formacio/curs/310400/postgrau-artificial-intelligence-deep-learning/) (2019). Both notebooks were originally created by [Santi Pascual](https://github.com/santi-pdp) and updated by various contributors.

- **Original version in Keras**: The Keras version was created by [Miriam Bellver](https://imatge.upc.edu/web/people/miriam-bellver) for the [Barcelona Technology School](https://barcelonatechnologyschool.com/master/master-in-big-data-solutions/) (BTS) in 2018.
- **UPC School Version**: Developed by Santi Pascual in 2019, with subsequent updates by [Daniel Fojo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-fojo/), [Xavier Giro](https://imatge.upc.edu/web/people/xavier-giro), [Pol Caselles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pcaselles/), [Gerard I. Gállego](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerard-gallego/), and [Juan José Nieto](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-jose-nieto-salas/).
- **Merging and Final Updates**: Merged and updated by [Laia Albors](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laia-albors-zumel-837a35211) and [Àlex Solé](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-sole-gomez/) (2024).
